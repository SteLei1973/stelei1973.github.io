# Agent Smith
Agent Smith is a fictional character and the main antagonist of The Matrix trilogy.

Smith began as an Agent, an AI program in the Matrix programmed to keep order within the system by terminating human simulacra which would bring instability to the simulated reality, as well as any rogue programs that no longer serve a purpose to the Machine collective.
To this end, Smith and his fellow Agents possess a number of superhuman attributes from their ability to bend the rules of the Matrix.
